### [Movie Data Correlations](https://github.com/jonbig/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/data_analysis_projects/movie_data_correlation_testing)

In this project we will examine IMDB data on thousands of movies to determine if any relationships exist between a movie's gross earnings and other attributes such as its budget, genre, rating etc.

This project features:

- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks
- Correlation matrices, scatterplots, heatmaps
- Linear regression

This project has been uploaded in a jupyter notebook which contains all of the code, formulas, and notes. [You can view the notebook here.](https://github.com/jonbig/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/data_analysis_projects/movie_data_correlation_testing/movies_project.ipynb)
