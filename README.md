# Data Science Portfolio 


This repository is a portfolio of data science projects I’ve completed. Many of the projects are designed to solve real-world problems I’ve encountered in my political/advocacy career, other projects were completed for educational purposes. Python based projects are typically presented in Jupyter Notebooks, with the exception of ad hoc programs such as web scrapers built to gather data for specific projects. SQL projects will contain a read me markdown file that will walk through the prijectstep by step. Each step will contain links to relevent SQL files. Data visualization projects will contain links to Tableau public where you can view and interact with the visualizations and dashboards.

All projects will follow a similar work flow:

1. **Ask** questions and define the problem.
2. **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
3. **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.
4. **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
5. **Share** data with your audience.
6. **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

Below you will find links to all projects each with a brief project summary. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!

Info about larger projects such as DMS.


# Data Analysis 

### [Movie Data Correlations](https://github.com/jonbig/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/data_analysis_projects/movie_data_correlation_testing)

### **Objective**

In this project we will examine IMDB data on thousands of movies to determine if any relationships exist between a movie's gross earnings and other attributes such as its budget, genre, rating etc.

### **Project Features**

- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks
- Correlation matrices, scatterplots, heatmaps
- Linear regression

# Data Visualization

### [Voter District Locator](https://github.com/jonbig/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/data_visualization_projects/voting_district_locater)

### **Objective**

Media and news outlets often neglect to cover state and local elections. As a result, most voters don’t know which candidates they are choosing between until they are completing their ballot. In this project we will design an interactive tool (in the form of a Tableau dashboard) that will allow voters in Colorado to quickly and easily find their state legislative districts, the candidates in those districts, and the relevant contact information. After election day, this dashboard can be easily modified to display the winning candidates. This will allow voters to easily see the legislators who represent them, allowing them to reach out to their local officials with questions or concerns.

### **Project Features**

- Python: (for data gathering)
- SQL (for data processing and table joins)
- Tableau (for data visualization and interactivity)



# Machine Learning


### [Image Classification Neural Network (Tensorflow)](https://github.com/jonbig/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/machine_learning_projects/image_classification_neural_network/image_classification_neural_network.ipynb)

### **Objective**

The objective of this project is to build, train, and test a neural network that can accurately classify the types of clothing appearing in images.

### **Project Features**
- Python
- Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy
- Neural Networks
