# Data Science Portfolio 
---

This repository is a portfolio of data science projects I’ve completed. Many of the projects are designed to solve real-world problems I’ve encountered in my political/advocacy career, other projects were completed for educational purposes. Python based projects are typically presented in Jupyter Notebooks, with the exception of ad hoc programs such as web scrapers built to gather data for specific projects. SQL projects are presented in SQL format. Data visualization projects will contain links to Tableau public where you can view and interact with the visualizations and dashboards.

All projects will follow a similar work flow:

1. Ask questions and define the problem.
2. Prepare data by collecting and storing the information.
3. Process data by cleaning and checking the information.
4. Analyze data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
5. Share data with your audience.
6. Act on the data and use the analysis results.

Below you will find links to all projects each with a brief project summary. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!
