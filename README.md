These are my data science projects. More text on what the goal if this portfolio is.

## Python Projects

### Python Project 1

This text is the project description. The objective of this project in particular is to determine optimal locations for a new gym or fitness center within Los Angeles. Specifically, the end result is to compile a list of Los Angeles neighborhoods that have no gyms or fitness centers within 3000 meters from their center points.

Data Methodology:

* Data Gathering
* Geocoding LA Neighborhoods
* Data Visualization: Mapping Los Angeles
* Exploring Neighborhood Venues With Foursquare API
* Clustering Neighborhoods by Gym & Fitness Center Data
