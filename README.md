# Data Science Portfolio 
---

This repository is a portfolio of data science projects I’ve completed. Many of the projects are designed to solve real-world problems I’ve encountered in my political/advocacy career, other projects were completed for educational purposes. Python based projects are typically presented in Jupyter Notebooks, with the exception of ad hoc programs such as web scrapers built to gather data for specific projects. SQL projects are presented in SQL format. Data visualization projects will contain links to Tableau public where you can view and interact with the visualizations and dashboards.

All projects will follow a similar work flow:

1. **Ask** questions and define the problem.
2. **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
3. **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.
4. **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
5. **Share** data with your audience.
6. **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

Below you will find links to all projects each with a brief project summary. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!


## Data Analysis 

What is data analysis?

## Data Visualization

Using data to tell compelling stories and illustrate metrics

[Voter District Locator](https://github.com/jonbig/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/data_visualization_projects/voting_district_locater)

Media and news outlets often neglect to cover state and local elections. As a result, most voters don’t know which candidates they are choosing between until they are completing their ballot. In this project we will design an interactive tool (in the form of a Tableau dashboard) that will allow voters in Colorado to quickly and easily find their state legislative districts, the candidates in those districts, and the relevant contact information. After election day, this dashboard can be easily modified to display the winning candidates. This will allow voters to easily see the legislators who represent them, allowing them to reach out to their local officials with questions or concerns.

This project includes:

- Python: (for data gathering)
- SQL (for data processing and table joins)
- Tableau (for data visualization and interactivity)
